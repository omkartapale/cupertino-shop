# Building a Cupertino app with Flutter

This project is based on a tutorial from Google Codelabs for building a Cupertino app with Flutter application.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Flutter Cupertino codelab!

In this codelab, you'll create a Cupertino (iOS-style) app using Flutter. The Flutter SDK ships with two styled widget libraries (in addition to the basic [widget library](https://docs.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/widgets-library.html)):

- [Material widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html) implements the Material design language for iOS, Android, web, and desktop.
- [Cupertino widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/cupertino-library.html) implements the current iOS design language based on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

Why write a Cupertino app? The Material design language was created for any platform, not just Android. When you write a Material app in Flutter, it has the Material look and feel on all devices, even iOS. If you want your app to look like a standard iOS-styled app, then you would use the Cupertino library.

You can technically run a Cupertino app on either Android or iOS, but (due to licensing issues) Cupertino won't have the correct fonts on Android. For this reason, use an iOS-specific device when writing a Cupertino app.

You'll implement a Cupertino style shopping app containing three tabs: one for the product list, one for a product search, and one for the shopping cart.
